possible additions
  o  check for numbered chromosomes, X, Y, and MT, and warn if any are missing
  o  think more about what to write to record.out
  o  check that the sequences in the fasta file are sorted as required for the atac-seq pipeline
  o  I look at effective genomes size
       o  two recommended procedures appear to be
            o  count non-N (and perhaps exclude simple repeats). The result is the effective
               genome size.
            o  using reads, count kmers and use the kmer distribution to estimate the
               effective genomes size
          The latter approach may be more accurate when the read type and lengths are given
          but the result must be specific to a particular experiment.
       o  I look at the Ensembl human genome GRCh38 both with and without repeat masking
          The fasta files are from ftp.ensembl.org:/pub/release-99/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna
            o  for Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_rm.toplevel.fa.filtered
               file:   Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_rm.toplevel.fa.filtered
               format: fasta
               nseq:   194
               nbase:  3099750718
               base counts:
               A   404287780  0.130
               C   276416369  0.089
               G   276691018  0.089
               N  1737522095  0.561
               T   404833456  0.131
               
               The 'effective genome size' is 1362228623. This is less than half (.49) the published counts of ~2.8e9.

           o  for nexus:/net/bbi/vol1/data/genomes_stage/human_gsrc/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa.finished
              the effective genome size is 2.95e+09, which is 1.05x the published counts. Good enough.

       o  I look at the Ensembl mouse genome GRCm38 using the finished fasta sequence file at
          nexus:/net/bbi/vol1/data/genomes_stage/mouse_gsrc
          /net/bbi/vol1/data/sw_install/kent_util/bin/faCount Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa.finished | grep '^total' | awk '{printf("%3.2e\n",$2-$7);}'
          2.65e+09
          The published effective genome size is 2652783500. That's the same!

       o  I look at the Ensembl macaque genome
          nexus:/net/bbi/vol1/data/genomes_stage/macaque_gsrc
          /net/bbi/vol1/data/sw_install/kent_util/bin/faCount Macaca_mulatta.Mmul_10.dna.toplevel.fa.finished | grep '^total' | awk '{printf("%3.2e\n",$2-$7);}'

     /net/bbi/vol1/data/sw_install/kent_util/bin/faCount ${FASTA_FINISHED} | grep '^total' | awk '{printf("%3.2e\n",$2-$7);}'
     2.94e+09
