** sequence utilities

fasta_getseqs takes the name of a file with sequence names and
              a fasta filename and writes the specified fasta
              sequences to stdout.

md5_seq writes the md5 checksum of each sequence in a sequence file
        (I tried it only on fasta files.)


** building
    o  fasta_getseqs: type
         make fasta_getseqs

    o  md5_seq: type
         make libsquid md5 md5_seq


** md5_seq checks
    o  compare base counts reported by md5_seq to the counts reported by
       samtools faidx. They give the same count values.
    o  extract chromosome 1 sequence into a file and compare the md5sum
       obtained using 'md5sum' utility to the value obtained using
       md5_seq. They are the same '2648ae1bacce4ec4b6cf337dcae37816'
       with this h38 chr 1 sequence. Extract chr 1 sequence from the
       distribution fasta file using the commands

         fasta_getseqs chr.lst Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa > 1.fa
         tail -n +2 1.fa | tr -d '\n' > 1.no_header_no_newline.fa
         md5sum 1.no_header_no_newline.fa
